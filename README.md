# Getting Started with Netflix-Clone

This project aims to provide a front-end, mobile-responsive implementation of Netflix. It uses the API from [the Movie Database](https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to retreive shows and movies from various genres currently hosted by Netflix. It also uses the react-YouTube library to fetch trailers to display when titles are clicked on*.

**This has limited functionality as not all trailers are retrievable or viewable on YouTube.*

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
